## What is eComX?

eComX.org is an active blockchain project entering its 2nd stage of development and managed by eComX Corporation, a United States Company.  During Stage 1 of the project, eComX completed and aggressive set milestones including the release of its “Dapp Store” and of its crypto-ecommerce marketplace www.eComX.world. 

For the 2nd stage of its development roadmap, eComX has a list of advanced blockchain innovations for the crypto-ecommerce economy, such as: 1. eComX Blockchain with built-in support for the Dandelion (de)anonymization protocol, for added protection to users’ private information.  2. eComX Asset Dataset Wrapping and Transport token technology to solve the interoperability problem between centralized asset datasets and the blockchain.  3.  A Parallel Listening and Firing Event Mechanism to allow multiple events to be combined into complete transactions (purchase, logistic, shipping, customs,…,etc.) then packaged into blocks for optimum parallel computing processing. 4.  A new generation of Hybrid Consensus Algorithms for maximum parallel transaction processing throughput. 5. eComX Optimized Turin-Complete VM, and 6. eComX Software Production and Testing Sandbox to enable our partners to quickly create, test, and deploy smart contracts and services based on the eComX Protocol.
